Freezin', rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again  
Oh, feelin' maybe he'll see a little better, set of days, ooh yeah  
Oh, hand out, faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, oh yeah  
Oh, dark grin, he can't help, when he's happy looks insane, oh yeah  

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies  
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away  
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again  
Life again, life again...  

Kneelin', looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read, ooh yeah  
Oh, prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything  
Oh, feelin', understands the weather of the winters on its way  
Oh, ceilings, few and far between all the legal halls of shame, yeah  

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies  
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away  
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again  

Whispering hands, gently lead him away  
Him away, him away...  
Yeah!  
Woo...ah yeah...fuck it up...  

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies  
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away  
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again, yeah  

Oh, whispering hands, gently lead him away  
Him away, him away...  
Yeah!  
Woo...uh huh...yeah, yeah, mommy, mommy...
