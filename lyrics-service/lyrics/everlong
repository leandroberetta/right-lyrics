Hello  
I've waited here for you  
Everlong  
Tonight  
I throw myself into  
And out of the red  
Out of her head she sang  

Come down  
And waste away with me  
Down with me  
Slow how  
You wanted it to be  
I'm over my head  
Out of her head she sang  

And I wonder  
When I sing along with you  
If everything could ever feel this real forever  
If anything could ever be this good again  
The only thing I'll ever ask of you  
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when she sang  

Breathe out  
So I can breathe you in  
Hold you in  
And now  
I know you've always been  
Out of your head  
Out of my head I sang  

And I wonder  
When I sing along with you  
If everything could ever feel this real forever  
If anything could ever be this good again  
The only thing I'll ever ask of you  
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when she sang  

So, Dad would take the Sundays off.  
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest.  
And so, because we were loud on Sundays, he'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep.  
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, "Dad, come on, please."  
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy.  

And I wonder  
If everything could ever feel this real forever  
If anything could ever be this good again  
The only thing I'll ever ask of you  
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
